# README

This is one of the practices from our Thunder special activity.

## TODO

* Hello World HTML
* ng hello world
* Bootstrap hello world
* header
* nav bar
* fuild layout or bootstrap css
* body background color
* static book list without paginator
* angular books
* extract nav bar code out of the index.html
* spring boot hello world using Gradle as build tool
* return json data as static resource
* return json to frontend
* define book model object and convert to resource
* setup db and create tables
* seed data manually
* connect DB and get data from db then pass to frontend
* db migration
* seed, separated?

## Thoughts

* should build a static page with books before introduce ng in

## What's Next?

* using bower to install angularjs
* using npm to install angularjs
* less and sass
